Hoster was a project of boredom for me. It appends localhosted urls to the end of your hosts file.

for the sake of normalcy, you'll want to compile it with the flag -o addhost,
or take a moment to change the name on line 17 where the script reprimands you for not sudoing. 

my next fit of boredom will include a menu to cat, del lines, and probably a flagged 
cmd line argument along the lines of addhost -a <site>.

I'm well aware this takes the place of almost no effort to accomplish the same thing. Balk not,
because it's just to play around and say I could.

One final note: do yourself a favor and either ./run this, or put it in /usr/local/bin.
