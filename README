Hoster was a project of boredom for me. It appends localhosted urls to the end of your hosts file.

for the sake of normalcy, you'll want to compile it with the flag -o addhost,
or take a moment to change the name on line 17 where the script reprimands you for not sudoing. 

my next fit of boredom will include a menu to cat, del lines, and probably a flagged 
cmd line argument along the lines of addhost -a <site>.

I'm well aware this takes the place of almost no effort to accomplish the same thing. Balk not,
because it's just to play around and say I could.

One final note: do yourself a favor and either ./run this, or put it in /usr/local/bin.

oh snap, i forgot to mention this was made on, and for osx snow leopard.

LEO-PARD MAAAAAAN

and I get the feeling it'll be fine on Lion because shit's all the same.

it should be fine on 'nix. edit crap as you need to. it's not like this is horribly complex stuff.
